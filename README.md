# Project Title

Email Classification using BERT is a lightweight NLP project that automatically categorizes emails (e.g., spam, promotions, social, updates) using a fine-tuned BERT model.

## About

This project fine-tunes BERT for text classification on email datasets. It includes data preprocessing, training scripts, evaluation metrics, and a prediction pipeline. The codebase is modular and easy to extend for custom labels or deployment.

## Tech Stack

- NLP & ML: BERT (HuggingFace Transformers), PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- Data: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Deployment (optional): FastAPI or Flask, Docker, Streamlit
